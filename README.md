# PyBer_Challenge
## Overview
All of the PyBer rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 for PyBer is analyzed in order to examine how ridesharing is used in three different areas: rural, suburban and urban. Create summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type using Python and Pandas. Using Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results 
By examining the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, the differences between rural, suburban, and urban ride-sharing are clear. Urban areas have the most total rides at 1,625, followed by suburban at 625 and Rural areas at 125.  There are roughly thirty times the number of drivers in urban areas versus rural areas, meaning that at any given time in a rural area, there may be one driver available while in an urban area there are more than two dozen. The average fare per ride is almost ten dollars cheaper in an urban setting than in a rural one, very likely because of the distance between pick-up and drop-off points. Rural drivers make a little more than three times the average of what urban drivers make per fare.

## Summary
Business recommendations for the CEO of PyBer Rideshare:  
- Include a service fee for urban rides of 10-15% of the total fare to bring the average fare closer to what Rural and Suburban drivers make. 
- Rural ride share may not be as well-known, therfore focusing on advertising near businesses that may benefit from the service could be a way to encourage more customers(for example at taverns). 
- March shows a downturn in fares for all three types of areas and discount fares could be offered to promote ridesharing in advance of the summer months.
